## [Unpublished]

### Added
 * Binary search for detection of minimal capacity needed for a task (function `mincap.bin_search`).
 
## [1.0.2]

### Added
 * data structures for *consumption Markov Decision Processes (CMDP)*
 * Solvers for strategy synthesis (and solving underlying decision problems) for Survival, Positive reachability 
 (of given target set $`T`$), almost-sure reachability of $`T`$, and almsot-sure BÃ¼chi objective on $`T`$
 * Algorithm for explicit representation of energy + MEC decomposition of this explicit MDP
 * example notebooks
