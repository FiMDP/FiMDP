.. note::
This package is under active development.

Introduction
------------
CMDP is a Python package that implements a polynomial-time controller synthesis algorithm for 
resource-constrained problems modeled as consumption Markov decision processes. The algorithm is detailed
in the work titled 'Qualitative Controller Synthesis for Consumption Markov Decision Processes' by 
František Blahoudek, Tomáš Brázdil, Petr Novotný, Melkior Ornik, Pranay Thangeda and Ufuk Topcu.
