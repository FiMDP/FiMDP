**Polynomial-time Algorithm for Controller Synthesis in Consumption Markov Decision Processes**

Full overview of the tool, installation options, documentation, and interactive examples:
[CMDP readthedocs](https://cmdp.readthedocs.io/).

**Citation info**: coming soon. 

## Overview

**CMDP** is a Python package that implements a polynomial-time controller synthesis algorithm for 
resource-constrained problems modeled as consumption Markov decision processes. The algorithm is detailed
in the work titled 'Qualitative Controller Synthesis for Consumption Markov Decision Processes' by 
František Blahoudek, Tomáš Brázdil, Petr Novotný, Melkior Ornik, Pranay Thangeda and Ufuk Topcu.

## Installation

**Docker Container**
Use this [docker container]() to run PACSMDP + Jupyter to access the interactive examples. 

**Binder**
Use this [link]() to access the interactive Jupter notebooks on the web without any installation.

**Manual Install**
Create a new virtual environment, clone this repository, and install the dependencies with `pip3`:

```
git clone https://github.com/pthangeda/consumption-MDP
cd consumption-MDP
pip3 install -e .
```

## Example Environments
