## Overview

**CMDP** CMDP is a Python package designed around a proof-of-concept tool implementing algorithms developed in our work on 
controller synthesis for resource-constrained problems modeled as Consumption Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs). The algorithms
are detailed in the work titled 'Qualitative Controller Synthesis for Consumption Markov Decision Processes' by 
František Blahoudek, Tomáš Brázdil, Petr Novotný, Melkior Ornik, Pranay Thangeda and Ufuk Topcu.

## Installation and Usage

**Binder**
Use this [link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pthangeda/consumption-MDP/master) to access the interactive Jupter notebooks on the web without any installation.

**Local Installation**
Refer to the [installation documentation](https://cmdp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

## Example Environments
We provide a number of examples in Interactive Jupyter notebooks to explore the features of our tool, to 
analyze its performance, and also to validate the results presented in our paper. The two primary examples are 
the problems of an electric vehicle routing with limited capacity and a multi-agent grid world inspired by the 
Mars 2020 mission. The notebooks can be found in the `examples` subdirectory and their contents and described in
detail [here](https://cmdp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html).
