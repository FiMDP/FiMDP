    starting location. Please not that giving more targets in target_locs
    means that we can choose 1 of them only and not visit the rest.

    changed by setting `starting_capacity`.

    If `max_starting_load` is given, don't consider capacities for
    which we need more than the given value from the starting
    location.

        `iterable` of those.
